/**
 * The heapsort algorithm can be divided into two parts.
 *
 * In the first step, a heap is built out of the data (see Binary heap ยง Building a heap). The heap is often placed in an array with 
 * the layout of a complete binary tree. The complete binary tree maps the binary tree structure into the array indices; each array 
 * index represents a node; the index of the node's parent, left child branch, or right child branch are simple expressions. For a 
 * zero-based array, the root node is stored at index 0; if i is the index of the current node, then
 *
 *  iParent(i)     = floor((i-1) / 2) where floor functions map a real number to the smallest leading integer.
 *  iLeftChild(i)  = 2*i + 1
 *  iRightChild(i) = 2*i + 2
 *
 * In the second step, a sorted array is created by repeatedly removing the largest element from the heap (the root of the heap), and 
 * inserting it into the array. The heap is updated after each removal to maintain the heap property. Once all objects have been 
 * removed from the heap, the result is a sorted array.
 * 
 * Heapsort can be performed in place. The array can be split into two parts, the sorted array and the heap. The storage of heaps as 
 * arrays is diagrammed here. The heap's invariant is preserved after each extraction, so the only cost is that of extraction.
